# State of the project & Roadmap
  State :
  
  - Contracts deployed on Testnet
  - Fix bug interaction when user try to borrow on front end
  - For testing purposes, except markets entered on Markets Tab & Dashboard of webapp, I used mock data to showcase features (Graph, Governance).
  - Fix MIA Vault on webapp

  Roadmap :
  
  - Implement DEX Aggregator for swaps efficiency
  - Implement veToken MIA for governance improvement and incentives
  - Implement Hedhing Module to keep SEB Stablecoin peg through perps or futures market
  - Optional but cool : Implement analytics page to showcase current usage of the protocol and users' positions
